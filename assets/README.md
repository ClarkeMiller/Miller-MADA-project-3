# Assets

The assets folder contains static assets like manually generated schematics/diagrams, bibtex files, csl style files, PDFs of references, and other such content. These assets are not code-based and are not generated by code.

This folder contains all static content from outside sources which is neither code nor generated by code. This includes, but is not limited to, schematics generated from biorender, other images taken from outside sources, `csl` files, `bib` files, pdf files of references, etc.
