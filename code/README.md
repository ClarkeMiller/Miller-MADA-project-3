# Code

All code relating to the project is in the code folder and subfolders. There are 3 sub-folders that do different parts of an analysis: Analyisis, Eda, and Processing. The folders contain files that do the data cleaning and analysis to illustrate the overall setup and workflow. See the readme files in those folders for details.
